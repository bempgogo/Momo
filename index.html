<a href="https://www.bucketlistly.blog/posts/10-days-flores-indonesia-itinerary" target="_blank" title="Flores 10-days-flores-indonesia-itinerary">I love to travel to different country.</a> <strong>I love meeting <u>new people</u> and tasting <u>different foods</u>.</strong> That is my favorite part. <br>In my opinion,  travelling overseas and to different countries, makes us more accepting each other's difference and teach us  repect for diffrent culture, tradtion, and belief.
<br>and It also helps me to tell some pretty interesting stories about my adventures. <br>I love talking to people about place they have visited.and things that they have seen in the world.<br><p>I think It is because I can easily relate to them. and it is for me share my stories and experience with them.hy.<br>Plus. I love getting recommendation about places to visit. It helps me to plan where my next holiday is going to be. </p>
